- Add smooth micro-interactions and animations to all interactive elements (buttons, cards, inputs, navigation)
- Enhance Header and Footer with refined layouts, backdrop blur, and smooth mobile menu transitions
- Polish form components with refined input styling, focus rings, floating labels, and inline validation feedback
- Implement skeleton loading states with shimmer animations for all data-fetching components
- Add smooth page transitions and scroll behaviors across all routes
- Refine card components with elevated shadows, subtle border radius, and interactive hover states
- Enhance responsive design with mobile-first patterns and touch-friendly interface elements

**User-visible outcome:** The application will have a polished, professional appearance with smooth animations, refined spacing, and sophisticated visual design that matches the quality standards of Google, Apple, and major cloud providers.
