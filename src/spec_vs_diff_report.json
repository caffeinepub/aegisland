  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive UI/UX refinements across all specified page components with sophisticated color systems, smooth animations, skeleton loading states, and refined spacing. However, some requirements lack complete evidence in the diff, particularly around page transitions (REQ-22) and certain form enhancements (REQ-20).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-22",
      "requirement": "Implement smooth page transitions and scroll behaviors across all routes in App.tsx using CSS transitions or animation libraries, with fade-in effects for new page content and smooth scrolling for in-page navigation",
      "reason": "App.tsx does not show evidence of route transition animations, fade effects between pages, or scroll behavior configuration. The file shows router setup but no transition/animation implementation.",

      "id": "REQ-20",
      "requirement": "Validation messages appear with smooth fade-in animations (partial)",
      "reason": "While forms show loading states and refined inputs, there is no explicit evidence of validation message animations or inline validation feedback with smooth transitions in the diff.",
